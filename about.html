	<h2>I live in Tennessee in a small town called Jackson County its between Nashville and Knoxville. I have a Passion for technology I have just recently graduated TCAT in Livingston TN. From here I earned my IT Support Specialist Diploma along with 4 MTA's which stands for Microsoft Technology Associate cert. During my time at TCAT I got alot of Hands-On Computer repair and learned critical thinking for trouble shooting purposes. Help Desk training is another plus two years of this we used the ticketing software SpiceWorks (google it) and would take calls from faculty or student around campus and Fix their problems. I also got into programming and wanted to learn how to host my own website... however being an computer nerd I wanted to set up the server from scratch so heres where my journey with Linux begins. <br>
	Cent-OS is a free version of RedHat minus the 500$ support fee I learned how to set up a LAMP server from ground up. Going from Windows to Linux was scary at first <em>why?</em> <i>hint</i> there is no GUI nothing to click or see just a blank terminal. After several months of practice I became at home with Linux. I have installed and configured owncloud which is a personal cloud stroage all the up to installing LAMP for basic web development. I plan on doing alot more soon. So how much programming do I know? I am profecient in HTML5, CSS3, Jquery (front end) and C# for basic windows apps (junior desktop programmer)</h2>
